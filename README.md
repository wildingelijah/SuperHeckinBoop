# Introduction

This project was designed by myself and four other students as a final project for a Game Design Interfaces class. The scripts were all coded using C# and the in game art assets are all default Unity assets which have been modified to fit the game.

## About The Project
 
The game (titled: Super Heckin' Boop) is a very quick to understand and easy to play game. It falls within the Arcade/Strategy genre as it is a two player game where the players face off against each other in a fun sumo wrestling match. The only twist is that each player is a rolling sphere. The aim is to knock the other player outside the ring using the moves available.

Developers: Elijah Wilding, Nathan Coit, Sullivan Stobo, Harrison Lau and Zack Palantzas.
